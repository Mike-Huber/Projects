# Tiki
This is the source code for a knowledge management system implemented through a Wiki using Python and the REST API. The original code that this is based on was created by a CSC440 Software Engineering professor - this code was then modified for learning purposes in the classroom. This is mostly for my personal reference if needed. I do NOT take credit for all of the code provided in this project.

**Note**: make sure to look at the readme.txt file in the Tiki main folder, it contains instructions on what configurations need to be changed if you want to run the Wiki on your local computer.
