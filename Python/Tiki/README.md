# Tiki
This is the source code for a knowledge management system implemented through a Wiki using Python and the REST API. The original code that this is based on was created by a CSC440 Software Engineering professor - this code was then modified for learning purposes in the classroom. This is mostly for my personal reference if needed.

**I do NOT take credit for all of the code provided in this project.**

Note: The readme.txt file in the Tiki main folder contains instructions on what configurations need to be changed if you want to run the Wiki on your local computer.
