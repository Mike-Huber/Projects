# Projects

This repository is for my personal use and is for storing my projects and test files for reference. There will be a mix of Java, C, C++, and possibly a few other languages. Each will be accompanied by a README file that describes what the program does, and what language it is written in. All projects added to the repository will also be listed below as a sort of index.
