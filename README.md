# Projects

This repository is for my personal use and is for storing my projects and test files for reference. There will be a mix of Java, C, C++, and possibly a few other languages. Each will be accompanied by a README file that describes what the program does, and what language it is written in. All projects added to the repository will also be listed below as a sort of index.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assembly

Everything in this assembly language folder is code that was written for my Computer Systems class when we went over IBM Assembly and how it works. This was written for basic purposes.

## CPP

Array_and_Vector_Selection_Sort: This C++ code creates a simple array and sorts it, as well as timing the sort. It also creates a simple vector and sorts that, also timing that. This was done in school to compare the different ways of sorting.

## Java

Music_BST: This is Java code that creates an interactive JavaFX window that allows the user to create nodes, which will be added directly to the tree, and run different types of traversals. These traversals will highlight the path they each took in orange.

TicTacToe_Server: This Java code uses a socket to connect clients to a pseudo-server and allows them to play TicTacToe against that server. From this project, we also looked at multi-threading in Java.

## Python

Tiki: This project was a Software Engineering task that included designing, securing, and configuring a knowledge management system through a Wiki using Python and the REST API.
